# Tennis Weather Checker
#### A fun personal project to learn PHP and Drupal 8 development.


Uses Weather Underground API to get today's weather for a given ZIP code.
Each hour of forecast is colored to indicate how favorable conditions will be to play tennis, taking into consideration chance of precipitation, wind speed, and temperature.

Hours shown can be configured in settings (default 8AM-10PM). Specific thresholds for favorable conditions rating can also be configured.
